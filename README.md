# Dotfiles

My personal vim, tmux, and shell configs and plugins

## Setup

##### Warning
This repo must be cloned in to your home directory, I have not gotten around to fixing that yet

Run ```./setup.py -h``` to see available commands

```./setup.py --install``` will install all dotfiles to your home directory
Other options include:
* ```--update```
* ```--clean```

### Expected Dir structure
~/dotfiles/
~/.vimrc -> ~/dotfiles/vimrc
~/.zshrc -> ~/dotfiles/zshrc
~/.oh-my-zsh -> ~/dotfiles/oh-my-zsh
~/.vim -> ~/dotfiles/vim
~/.git-prompt.sh -> ~/dotfiles/git-prompt.sh
and more of that kind of strucutre...

## Additional Config
* Iterm Themes: http://iterm2colorschemes.com/
* Powerline patched fonts: https://github.com/powerline/fonts
